## IPS Tools
---

To help in the journey to use IPS in combination with other adjacent, related, upstream or downstream specifications, we provide you a ready "sandbox" that you can use locally or deploy. 

In the [ips-server](https://github.com/DigitalSQR/fhir-ips-kit/tree/main/ips-server) folder of [this site's repository](https://github.com/DigitalSQR/fhir-ips-kit) you find the key components:
* a docker compose image
* some web apps for experimenting and interacting with the server
  * A general purpose FHIR resource validator - you can use to validate resource instances against IPS.
  * A FHIR IPS viewer 

{: .info-title }
Use these tools for development, experimenting, validating.
